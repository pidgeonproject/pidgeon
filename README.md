Pidgeon is an open source IRC client

How to build pidgeon
=====================

On Windows:
 - You need to install GTK# for .Net http://download.xamarin.com/Installer/gtk-sharp-2.12.20.msi
 - Then just open the project in visual studio and hit build

On linux:
```
# enter the folder where you downloaded the source code and execute
./configure
make
#or in order to install pidgeon system wise
make && sudo make install
#to uninstall
sudo make uninstall
```

Compiling extensions:

Note: build.sh script for linux will build all default extensions for you, this is only needed on windows and mac

You will probably want to install at least tab completion, for that you first need to build pidgeon. Then open the extension you want to build and ensure that Pidgeon reference is existing, if it's not simply replace it with existing reference to Pidgeon.exe so that you can build the extension.
